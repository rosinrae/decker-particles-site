# MegaParticle™ Coating Flake
## [order stock](/order/stock/) &nbsp; &nbsp; [order custom](/order/custom/)

> ### Size
> An average powder coating particle has a volume of 5.5x10¯⁹in³.
> <br/>A half-inch **MegaParticle™** has a volume of 2.5x10¯³in³,
> <br/>more than ***450,000 X*** as large.

> ### Shape
> Although traditional powder coatings are tiny (typical average size of 45 microns),
> <br/>much larger particles may be applied by electrostatic spray if they are shaped as _flakes_
> <br/>The shape a flake particle will produce in the final coating depends on the "flow" of its composition.
> <br/>Particles with high flow tend to produce round areas of color.
> <br/>Flakes with low flow retain their angular shape.


> ### Effect
> When you blend black and white powder, you get gray.
> <br/>When you blend black and white flake, you can achieve hundreds of different exciting appearances,
> <br/>depending on blend ratios, flake size, and flow. 
> <br/>See our gallery to scratch the surface!

> ### Compatibility
> **MegaParticle™** coating flake is available in all the same chemistries, colors, and glosses as powder coatings.
> <br/>Flake may be co-applied with powder, and co-cured.
